* Update gem.json configuration so it evolves over many generations with few individuals.
* Test population more thoroughly
* Unit test everything and, after using them as inspiration, delete current console.log test files.
* Recreate DEMO
* Update README
* Make more extensible.
* Consider creating a higher level 'main' class.
* Do all of the TODO's in the class files.
* Turn into a web service.
* Tie into a web site and have it optimize some simple attributes, such as the background color or font.
* Add methods to return a JSON of the state of the current object.
* Add ability to save the state of the objects in a database.
* Handle configuration file without a known fittest individual.
* Remove old test.js and redundant files from repo.
* Store results and final population in a database such as Mongo (fits this JSON approach well).
* Create test JSON objects in separate files for configuring each class e.g. genome.json.
* Should be able to speed up performance by adding some of my methods to the prototype (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). This is useful for operations that are not unique to a particular instance of an object.
* Is 'this.' for properties redundant? 
* Handle an empty Individual
* Turn repeated helper methods and print functions into their own helper library
* Write blog post
